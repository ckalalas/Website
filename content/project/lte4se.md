Considering a specific innovation objective, LTE 4 Smart Energy (LTE4SE) aims to evaluate and demonstrate how LTE technologies can enable Smart Grid applications, from monitoring to real time control. In particular, the project will produce a holistic view on the economic and technical tradeoffs for delivering Smart Gird services using public LTE infrastructure. Running under the “Smart Energy Systems Action” Line, the project brings together the following partners: Siemens, Ericsson and KTH.

The project received funding from the EIT ICT Labs.
