The main scientific focus of ADVANTAGE (ADVanced communicAtions and iNformaTion processing in smArt Grid systEms) will be on advancing the understanding of the smart grid operation, providing architectural solutions for smart grid systems and the contribution of innovative information and communication technology (ICT) solutions. Within this broad research area, ADVANTAGE is organised to achieve research advances in the following four target areas: 

- Smart Homes: progressing the development of ICT solutions and applications in household environments to intelligent, customer-friendly, efficient and incentive-responsive home energy management solutions for smart grid household consumers 

- Neighbourhood/Industrial Area Networks: providing efficient wide-area ICT solutions for advanced smart grid data exchange, gathering, processing and decision making in larger consumer conglomerations and environments 

- Micro Grids: developing ICT solutions for challenging problem of integration and distributed control of micro grids in smart grids 

- Intelligent Distribution Networks: advancements towards intelligent distribution network that will maintain efficient distribution management, load clustering, demand side management, distributed micro grid control, and two-way communication with customers and micro grids through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)
