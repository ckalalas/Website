abstract = "The European Marie Curie Project ADVANTAGE (Advanced Communications and Information processing in smart grid systems) was launched in 2014. It represents a major inter-disciplinary research project into the topic of Smart Grid technology. A key aspect of the project is to bring together and train 13 early stage researchers from the traditionally separate fields of power systems and communications engineering research. This chapter describes some of the initial research results that have arisen from the project and to highlight some of the key advances and developments that are being studied in the project. The major research focus of the ADVANTAGE project is on advancing technologies for the smart grid, providing architectural solutions and developing innovative information and communications technology (ICT) solutions to support its operation."
