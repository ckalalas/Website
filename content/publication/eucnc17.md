abstract = "This paper provides a view to Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach for smart grid operation adopted in P2P-SmarTest project. It provides an overview on solutions proposed for distributed P2P energy trading, P2P grid control and wireless communication enabling the proposed P2P operation. The paper proposes some business models that can be adopted in a P2P setting. We also outline the barriers and enablers against and for adopting local or regional P2P based electricity operations."
