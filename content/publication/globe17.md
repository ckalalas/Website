abstract = "The reliable support of event-driven massive machine-type communication (MTC) requires radical enhancements in the standard LTE random access channel (RACH) procedure to avoid performance degradation due to a high probability of collision in the preamble transmission. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the cell size and the number of preambles generated from a single or multiple root sequences and we study their impact on the achieved reliability. Based on an analytical expression of the RACH reliability per cell, we introduce an interference- and load-aware cell-planning mechanism that efficiently allocates the root sequences among multiple cells and regulates the traffic load to guarantee reliable support of MTC. In addition, we propose a realistic traffic model that accurately captures the event-driven nature of MTC traffic. Finally, a performance evaluation of a power distribution automation scenario with MTC-overload reveals the superior performance of our proposed mechanism in terms of RACH reliability against benchmarking network-deployment schemes."
