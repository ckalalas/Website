# About
I received the Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens and the M.Sc. Degree in Wireless Systems from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in 2011 and 2014 respectively.
During the years 2013-2017, I held research positions both in industry (Ericsson Eurolab and ABB Corporate Research) and academia (KTH and Aalborg University).

In 2014, I joined the Machine-to-Machine Communications Department at the Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya while pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Signal Theory and Communications at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. My research interests include random-access protocols and resource-allocation techniques with applications to smart energy and networked control systems.
